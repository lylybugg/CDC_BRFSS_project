# Exploratory Data Analysis Using CDC's 2021 BRFSS

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) conducts an annual Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). It is a national survey conducted through random telephone and cellular surveillance. The overarching goal is to evaluate risk factors contributing to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the population and help guide health policies. Data can be found here: <https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2021.html>

This was a project completed for a data analysis in R course. We were tasked with selecting four variables from this data set: one response variable and the three predictors.
